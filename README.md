This project explores and analyzes customer churn behavior for a retail bank using Microsoft Excel. 
By cleaning and transforming the data, creating calculated columns, pivot tables, charts, and a dynamic dashboard, I identify key insights that help understand which customer segments are more likely to leave the bank. 
This type of analysis is critical for retention strategy, especially in financial services and fintech environments.

Key Insights:
Customers with more than one product with the bank are significantly less likely to close accounts.  This shows the importance of cross-selling.  
The bank should explore further investments into special offers for existing customers or additional sales training for employees.

An overwhelming majority of customers who complained closed their accounts.  This shows a major need for more training on problem solving and retention.

More than half of all accounts that were closed were in Germany.  This requires some additonal exploration of products offered in Germany as well as insights into what German customers want. 
This suggests that the bank is not meeting German customers' needs as well as in other countries.
